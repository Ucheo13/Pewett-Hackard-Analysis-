After removing the duplicates, we were able to see the amount of each title there is, Senior Engineer the most and Manager the least frequent. 

Will need to hire more Senior Engineers 

A substantial number of employees were removed for not having the birth year 1965 in the mentorship eligibility  

Nearly 2000 employees are eligible for the program  

## Summary
